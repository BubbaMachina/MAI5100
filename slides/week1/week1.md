**The science of making machines that**:  
- Think like humans?  
- Act like humans?  
- Think rationally?  
- Act rationally?

> ‚ÄúA computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human.‚Äù ‚Äì **Alan Turing**

In **this course**, we adopt a **rational agent** viewpoint:
- An **agent** perceives its environment, reasons about it, and acts to **maximize** its goals.  
- AI is about designing such **intelligent agents**.
